# Tandem

## Download
We recommend using your favourite manager to download this plugin (Vundle, vim-plug,
etc.)

Alternatively, you can manually install this package by cloning this repository
and copying it to the nvim plugins:
```
$HOME/.config/nvim/
```

## Setup
Regardless of how you download the plugin, you'll need to perform a one-time setup.  
Launch `nvim` run `:UpdateRemotePlugins`, and quit.  
You'll be able to use Tandem from the next launch onwards!
